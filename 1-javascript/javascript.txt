1.var vs let vs const

var is functional scope
let and const is block scope

{
    var a = 5
}
console.log(a) // 5

{
    let a = 5
}
console.log(a) //a is not defined

{
    let a = 5
    console.log(a) //5
}

{
    const a = 5
}
console.log(a) //a is not defined

{
    const a = 5
    console.log(a) //5
}

2.Variable shadowing

function test(){
    let a = 'Hello'
    if(true){
        let a = 'Hi'
        console.log(a)//Hi
    }
    console.log(a) //Hello
}

function test(){
    var a = 'Hello'
    let b = 'Goodbye'
    
    if(true){
        let a = 'Hello'
        var b = 'Goodbye' //illegal shadowing error
        console.log(a)
        console.log(b)
    }

}
a var can be showed using a let about cannot do wise versa

3.Declaration

var we can be redeclared multiple times
var a;
var a;
let and const cannot be redeclared
let a;
let a; //a already declared
const a;
const a;//missing initializer in const Declaration

4.Declaration without initialisation
var a;//no error
let b;//no error
const c;//error -missing initializer in const Declaration
const c=10; //no error
let and var can be declared without initialisation 
but const cannot 

5.Reinitialisation

var a = 5;
a = 6;
//no eeror
let a = 5;
a = 6;
//no error
const a = 5 ;
a = 6; //assigment to constant Variable

var and let can be Reinitialisationor updated but const cannot be

6.Hoisting
during creation phase javascript engines moves the declaration of variable on the to of the code

console.log(count);
var count = 1; //undefined

how javascript will make this code

var count;
console.log(count);
count=1;

console.log(count);
let count = 1; //cannot acess 'count before initialisation
let and const is Hoisted to TDZ (TDZ is the area where the a variable exists but it cannot be accessed until it is not declared)


*Map,Filter,Reduce*

7.Map - creating a new array from existing one applying function to each one of the element of array
filter - takes each element in an array and apply a condition if the condition is true element gets pushed to output array 
reduce - reduces an array of values down to one values

8.Polyfills of map,filter,reduce
